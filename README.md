# Infrastructure Kata

First practical training program is to build good container images with passion!
This is insprired form the great [Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) initiative and many XP- and Agile friends. Now we want to start infrastructure coding with passion. 

## The Main Goal

The goal of this kata examples is to practice a looser style of experimental building container stuff. Look for as many different ways of handling the issues as possible. Consider the various tradeoffs of each. What techniques are best for exploring these part of an IT system? For recording them? How can you validate the solution is reasonable?

## What’s a Infrastructure Kata?

As a group, DevOps, Cloud Native or SRE engineers don’t practice enough. Most of our learning takes place on the job, which means that most of our mistakes get made there as well. Other creative professions practice: artists carry a sketchpad, musicians play technical pieces, poets constantly rewrite works. In karate, where the aim is to learn to spar or fight, most of a student’s time is spent learning and refining basic moves. The more formal of these exercises are called kata.

To help engineers get the same benefits from practicing, we’re putting together a series of code kata: simple, artificial exercises which let us experiment and learn without the pressure of a production environment. Our suggestions for doing the kata are:

find a place and time where you won’t be interrupted
focus on the essential elements of the kata
remember to look for feedback for every major decision
if it helps, keep a journal of your progress
have discussion groups with other DevOps, Cloud Native or SRE engineers, but try to have completed the kata first
There are no right or wrong answers in these kata: the benefit comes from the process, not from the result.
